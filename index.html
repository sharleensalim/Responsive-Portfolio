			<h2>About Me</h2><hr>
			<img id="profile-photo" src="http://i.imgur.com/uaB8leF.jpg" alt="profile-photo">
			<p> I honestly cannot tell you how I am sitting in my dining room at midnight on a Friday coding HTML and CSS. I'm typically the one suggesting restaurants for dinner, convincing those who were planning on staying in to come out with me to this new speakeasy that I just read about, while also reminding them that we can't stay out any later than 2AM so we don't miss our 7AM Barry's Bootcamp the next morning. Not only that, but I also suffer from the worst case of FOMO... as I'm cranking away on Sublime Text resisting the urge to check snapchat and instastories. <br><br>
			So that's me. My name is Sharleen and I'd been living in New York City for six years until about two months ago. I went to NYU, studied business, went into strategy consulting (where have you heard that before, right?) and then decided that I needed a change, a break from the corporate life and cramped city streets, maybe go somewhere with breathable air? Don't get me wrong. NYC will forever be the city I call home and hold a special place in my heart. I am so grateful to the city for the unique subway rides, the once strangers that I now call family, the unaffordable pre-fixe drunches, and above all, for the grind. Now here I am, continuing to chase my (still slightly confused) dreams on the opposite coast, striving to keep that grind going. Follow along on my journey here! I cannot wait to see where it takes me. </p>
